# Hey there o/! 
# 
# We just wanted to let you know that we care a great deal about    
# making our git history clean, maintainable and easy to access for 
# all our contributors. Commit messages are very important to us,  
# which is why we have a strict commit message policy in place.     
# Please use the following guidelines to format all your commit     
# messages:
# 
#     <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#     <BLANK LINE>
#     <body>
#     <BLANK LINE>
#     <footer>
# 
# Please note that:
#  - The HEADER is a single line of max. 50 characters that         
#    contains a succinct description of the change. It contains a   
#    type, an optional scope, and a subject
#       + <type> describes the kind of change that this commit is   
#                providing. Allowed types are:
#             * feat (feature) - a new feature
#             * fix (bug fix) - a bug fix
#             * docs (documentation) - documentation only changes
#             * style (formatting, missing semicolons, …) - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
#             * refactor - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
#             * perf (performance) - A code change that improves performance
#             * test (when adding missing tests) - Adding missing or correcting existing tests
#             * chore (maintain) - Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
#             * hotfix (hotfix)
#       + <scope> can be anything specifying the place of the commit    
#                 change
#       + <subject> is a very short description of the change, in   
#                   the following format:
#             * imperative, present tense: “change” not             
#               “changed”/“changes”
#             * no capitalised first letter
#             * no dot (.) at the end
#  - The BODY should include the motivation for the change and      
#    contrast this with previous behavior and must be phrased in   
#    imperative present tense 
#  - The FOOTER should contain any information about Breaking       
#    Changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that   
#    this commit closes
# 
# Thank you <3
